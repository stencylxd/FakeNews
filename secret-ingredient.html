    <h1>Share the Secret Ingredient: Strawberries</h1>
    <p>There are many pick-your-own farms where I live that grow strawberries.<br>
    Strawberries are a very sweet and healthy ingredient that can top most desserts<br>
    or some meals like breakfast or lunch. They are many strawberries used where I live.</p>
    <h2>What are strawberries used in?</h2>
    <p>You can find them as a built in topping at most ice cream places or even just for sale as a snack.<br>
    You can also find strawberry-flavored things, but they really go best by themselves because they don't<br>
    really work with most dishes. Strawberry is mostly used as a flavor however.<br>
