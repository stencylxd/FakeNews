    <h1>Beware of Fake News!</h1>
    <p>
        In the online world, opinions are everywhere. You have to make sure you are getting facts, not opinions<br>
        when looking online. Websites like Twitter or Facebook are very vulnerable to this becuase you can pay <br>
        money to advertise FAKE news! Have you seen this kind of stuff floating around? Well here are some <br>
        ways that you can detect fake news!
    </p>
    <h2>Does it make sense to me?</h2>
    <p>
        If it's something not even close to common sense, such as "PURPLE DEER ARE KILLING OFF THE POPULATION"<br>
        then it's probably fake. You can also connect dots by comparing other news sources to see if they have the same<br>
        story. If lots of news sources are telling the same things, then the stories are probably fact. If there is only one story,<br>
        then it's probably not true.
    </p>
    <h2>Is this a trusted news source?</h2>
    <p>
        Have you been using this news source before? Does it credit outside sources and use pictures/audio/video? If so,<br>
        you are probably looking at a true story. But make sure you check the outside soruces first. People will put in a lot<br>
        of effort into tricking you. The news source in question and the credited sources could all be made by the same guy.<br>
        One other thing to take into account is whether the other stories the news source created make sense. If they only<br>
        have one story, you probably shouldn't trust the source. If the other stories don't make sense, then you probably shouldn't<br>
        trust the source. 
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Fake news is everywhere, and common online. If you want a reliable news source, you should read the local newspaper.<br>
        It's very easy to setup a real looking news website, so you should always be careful when reading a story or article.<br>
        If a story doesn't make sense and doesn't have external sources or media (sound, video, pictures) then it's probably<br>
        false. You should also check other news sources to see if they are talking about the same thing, which can backup <br>
        that story and source. If you haven't heard the news source from anywhere (communinty, friends, online reviews), then<br>
        you probably should do some reasearch on it. Some sources I recommend are: 
        <a href="https://cnn.com">CNN</a>, <a href="https://npr.org">NPR</a>, and <a href="https://bbc.com">BBC</a>.
